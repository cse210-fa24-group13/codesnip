# Greenfield vs. Brownfield for Code Snippet Manager Project

  

## Context and Problem Statement

Developers often create reusable code snippets for common programming tasks. These snippets are extremely useful, but can often be disorganized, difficult to locate, or scattered across multiple systems and tools. Building upon an existing code snippet management VSCode extension, our goal is to create a user-friendly platform that allows developers to efficiently organize, access, reuse, and share their code snippets with others, enhancing productivity.

We initially considered developing this solution as a greenfield project, starting from scratch to tailor every feature to our specifications.

However, during our research, we discovered an open-source project on GitHub called "Snippets — Supercharge Snippets in VS Code." This extension already offers a wide range of features that enhance snippet management within Visual Studio Code, including:

-   Snippet Creation: Allows users to create snippets with minimal effort.
    
-   Snippet Access: Provides quick access to snippets from anywhere in VS Code.
    
-   Search: Fast and efficient snippet search functionality.
    
-   Snippet Management: Flexible organization, editing, and deletion of snippets.
    
-   Customization: Personalization options for user snippets.
    
-   Synchronization: Syncing options for sharing snippets across devices and with other users.
    
-   Enhanced Usability: Improved developer-friendliness through powerful snippet management features.
    

Given that these functionalities align closely with our project goals, it would be redundant to redevelop them from scratch. Instead, we see an opportunity to build upon the existing features of this extension in a brownfield approach, adding unique features and expanding on its current capabilities to better meet modern developers' evolving needs.

  
  

## Decision Drivers

-   Time and Resource Efficiency: Time is limited so we want higher efficiency.
    
-   Focus on innovation: New functionalities should enhance user productivity, offering features that solve real problems and make the development process more efficient.
    
-   Minimizing Risk: We want to minimize the risks encountered during implementation.
    
-   User-Friendliness: The solution should prioritize ease of use, ensuring a seamless experience for developers.
    

  

## Considered Options

-   Greenfield
    
-   Brownfield
    

  

  

## Decision

We decided to adopt a brownfield approach and build upon the "Snippets — Supercharge Snippets in VS Code" extension.

Reasons for Decision:

1.  Feature Reuse: Many existing features (such as snippet creation, search, and syncing) closely match our project requirements, allowing us to leverage existing functionality without the need to redevelop these from scratch.
    
2.  Reduced Development Time: By using an existing solution, we can reduce the overall development time and allocate more resources to innovative features that enhance snippet management.
    
3.  Improved Developer Experience: Visual Studio Code’s snippet management system is already well integrated into its ecosystem, providing a seamless experience for developers. Enhancing this platform builds on familiar workflows and supports our goal of maximizing productivity.
    
4.  Focus on New Features: This approach allows us to focus our efforts on adding new functionality, such as improved collaboration, additional customization, analytics on snippet usage, and advanced organization features.
    

### Consequences

-   Dependency on Existing Code: Leveraging an existing project introduces a dependency, meaning that future updates or changes in the base project could affect our solution.
    
-   Limited Control Over Core Functionality: While we can customize and extend the existing code, we are limited by the current design and architecture, which might impact the flexibility of certain aspects.
    
-   Potential Compatibility Issues: As we introduce new features, there may be compatibility challenges when integrating with the existing codebase.
    

  

### Confirmation

We held meetings with all team members to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both options. Considering the challenges we might encounter, it became clear that the brownfield approach was the more suitable solution. To ensure alignment, we conducted a poll, and the majority of the team members supported the brownfield approach. The decision to go with a brownfield approach was confirmed through technical validation, team and TA feedback, and a thorough analysis of the existing codebase and features.

  

  

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Brownfield Approach

-   Good, because a brownfield approach enables faster deployment by leveraging an existing project. Since we have limited time, we would want to avoid reinventing already existing functionality and focus on the new features.
    
-   Good, because it provides code quality and stability. The existing extension has undergone community testing and refinement, reducing the likelihood of foundational bugs. This allows us to start with a more stable codebase and focus on building new, reliable features.
    
-   Bad, because the repo we choose may involve some new programming languages or concepts that we have not faced before. We need to read through the code and it is not guaranteed that we can understand all parts of the codebase. We need to do some research on those. Sometimes it will be hard to get familiar with new techniques quickly.
    

  

### Greenfield Approach

-   Good, because it provides Complete Control. We have full control over the design, architecture, and features of the project, allowing us to tailor everything from scratch to meet the exact specifications of our needs. No constraints from existing code or architecture, enabling us to innovate freely and implement any features or ideas without having to work within the limitations of an existing system.
    
-   Bad, because it requires High Development Effort. Building from scratch requires more time and resources to develop foundational features (e.g., snippet creation, management, searching, syncing), which are already available in existing solutions.
    
-   Bad, because a greenfield project lacks the reliability and stability of an established system, so there's a risk of unforeseen technical challenges that may arise during development and deployment.
    

  

  

## Next Steps

-   Review and assess the existing codebase of "Snippets — Supercharge Snippets in VS Code" for areas of improvement and extension.
    
-   Define and prioritize additional features that align with our project’s goals, ensuring they add significant value beyond what is already provided.
    
-   Develop a roadmap for integration and enhancement, ensuring that our modifications are modular and maintainable.
