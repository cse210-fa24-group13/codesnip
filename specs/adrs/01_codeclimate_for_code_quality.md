# Choosing CodeClimate for Code Quality Analysis

  

## Context and Problem Statement

Our Code Snip manager tool project requires an automated code quality analysis tool to maintain high code standards, identify potential issues early, and streamline the code review process. We are considering three popular options: CodeClimate, Codacy and SonarQube. We need to decide considering the scaler of our project, which tool best fits our needs and will provide the most value to our development workflow.
  

## Decision Drivers

- Ease of use and quick setup

- Integration with existing tools like GitHub

- Support for our project's programming languages - JavaScript, TypeScript

- Simplicity and relevance of feedback for smaller codebases
  

## Considered Options

- CodeClimate
- Codacy
- SonarQube
    


## Decision

Chosen option: "CodeClimate", because it offers a simpler setup, better integration with GitHub, and a more straightforward grading system that is well-suited for small projects.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### CodeClimate

- Good, because it has a simple grade system

- Good, because it offers auto-sync with GitHub 

- Good, because it provides a feature for identifying hotspots

- Good, because it has a reputation for stability and used in production

- Bad, because it has limited support for certain programming languages

  

### Codacy

- Good, because it supports a wide range of programming languages

- Good, because it offers more customizable options for code patterns and rules

- Good, because it provides a flexible pricing model based on the number of lines of code analyzed

- Bad, because its user interface may be less intuitive and harder to navigate

-  Bad, because it may require more setup and configuration time initially
  
### SonarQube

- Good, because it offers both cloud-based and self-hosted options

- Good, because it has a larger and more active community

- Good, because it provides more in-depth analysis with detailed reports, including security vulnerabilities

- Good, because it tracks code complexity and smell trends over time

- Bad, because it may be overly complex for smaller projects

- Bad, because the free community edition may lack some advanced features we might want in the future

  

## Next Steps

- We plan to reassess this decision in the upcoming sprint to evaluate its impact on our development process and code quality, considering the growth and evolving needs of our project.
