## Lacked

* Reviewing and closing the open pull requests
    * Resolution: Assign atleast 2 reviewers and tag them on Discord/ Mattermost. Responsibility of the reviewer to review the code at the earliest.
* Everyone is not in sync
    * Resolution: Team members should take the initiative and ask others about the progress. Also, post updates regularly on the progress-update channel.
* Meeting Efficiency
    * Resolution: Initial sprints the scope was not clear. Going forward, we will try to have a proper agenda and invite only the members required for a meeting



Note: We have decided to retrospect and discuss all the points at the Team level and not at an individual level. Hence all the points above do not include any specific member's name.
