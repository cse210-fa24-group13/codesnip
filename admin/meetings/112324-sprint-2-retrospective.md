## Liked
* Progress being made
* Good work being done. Completion of assigned tasks within sprint
* Regular sprint meetings
* Every task is done as expected
* Meetings on point
* Standup meetings
* Shorter, more focused meetings
* Everyone is very involved
* Good Presentation of Chapter 3!
* Appreciation to the team for taking ownership on the tasks assigned to them! Great job!

## Learnt
* How to compile code for VScode extension and how to change functionality and UI in VScode extension
* Code coverage report integration with Codeclimate using C8Â 
* How Github gists work
* What error might happen when update dependencies, e.g. For ESLint we need to use new file format
* How to publish websites on Github programatically


## Lacked
* Making web app still ambiguous
    * Resolution: We are working on finalizing the wireframes. We will be having a call on 25th Nov to discuss the same.
* We should limit ourselves to just the current sprint task, work in parallel on getting tasks for next sprint ready
    * Resolution: Team members should be proactive & try to get  tasks ready for implementation before next sprint
* Everyone should be more vocal in meetings
    * Resolution: Team members should raise their hand wherever they feel things are not going as per plan or if they see any obvious challenges.




Note: We have decided to retrospect and discuss all the points at the Team level and not at an individual level. Hence all the points above do not include any specific member's name.
